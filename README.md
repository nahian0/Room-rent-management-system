# Room-rent-management-system
We designed a system where a house owner can rent their house by giving details information about
the house including pictures. And people can find those rooms searching by location. And also able to book a room
for a selected time by paying online. The owner and user have different login systems. The owner can create an
account after verification. We used HTML, CSS, javascript, and Jquery for the front-end. And For the back-end, we
used Php and Mysql.
